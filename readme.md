Learning about Java encapsulation
benefits:
- method can change data type to match field
- class can be changed as long as interface remains
- encourages good oo design

static modifier is applied to method or variable
=variable shared by all objects in a class
=can be accessed without instantiating
=is not unique to an object instance

instance 
=unique to an individual object

promotion ->
casting <-
int float double long byte short

access control: public vs. private:
- public is accessible and changeable by anyone who has an instance of the class
- private only accessible within the class

format primer:
"$%.2f"
$ = literal character
% = substitute for 2nd argument
.2f = floating decimal with 2 digits of precision

object reference passed to methods
- object reference is copied
